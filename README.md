# Custom API (Optional)
If you prefer to configure your own LLM, and do not want to use the Player2 App, you can follow these instructions:

Creature Pals **requires** an AI / LLM (large language model) to generate text (characters and chat). There are many different
options for connecting an LLM. 
1. **Free & Local**: Use open-source and free-to-use LLMs without any API fees. [**Difficulty: Hard**]
2. **Bring Your Own Key**: Use your own API key from providers like OpenAI or Groq. [**Difficulty: Medium**]

### 1. Free & Local
CreaturePals fully supports **free and open-source** LLMs. To get started:

- An HTTP endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completion JSON syntax is required. We highly recommend using:
  - [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) & [LiteLLM](https://litellm.vercel.app/) as your HTTP proxy.
  - **LiteLLM Features:**
    - Supports over **100+ LLMs** (e.g., Anthropic, VertexAI, HuggingFace, Google Gemini, and Ollama).
    - Proxies them through a local HTTP endpoint compatible with Creature Pals.
    - **Note:** Running a local LLM on your computer requires a powerful GPU.
  - Set the local HTTP endpoint in-game:
    - `/creaturepals url set "http://ENTER-YOUR-HTTP-ENDPOINT-FROM-LITE-LLM"`
    - `/creaturepals model set ENTER-MODEL-NAME`
    - `/creaturepals timeout set 360`

### 2. Bring Your Own Key
For those already using a third-party API (e.g., OpenAI, Groq):

- Integrate your own API key for seamless connectivity.
- Costs depend on the providerâ€™s usage-based pricing model.
- By default, Creature Pals uses the OpenAI endpoint and `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, known for its balance of low cost and fast performance.
- Be aware that OpenAIâ€™s developer API does not include free usage. Please review the [OpenAI pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for detailed information.
- To create an OpenAI API key, visit [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), and use the **+ Create new secret key** button.
- Set the API key & model in-game:
  - `/creaturepals key set <YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE>`
  - `/creaturepals model set gpt-3.5-turbo`
